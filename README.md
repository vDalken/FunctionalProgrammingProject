# Functional Bank App

## Description

This project is a simple command-line bank application that embraces functional programming concepts like immutability, higher-order functions, and pure functions. Users can perform basic banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking the account balances, and see their transaction history.

## Features

1. **Account Creation:**
   - Users can create bank accounts.
   - Account details (account number, balance, etc.) are immutable once created.

2. **Deposit and Withdrawal:**
   - Users can deposit money into their accounts.
   - Users can withdraw money from their accounts.
   - Operations return a new account state without modifying the existing state.

3. **Account Balances:**
   - Users can check their account balances.

4. **Transaction History:**
   - A transaction history feature tracking all deposits and withdrawals for each account was implemented.

5. **Functional Programming Concepts:**
   - Immutability in order to minimize mutable state.
   - Pure functions with no side effects.

6. **Higher-Order Functions:**
   - Functions that take functions as parameters, enabling enhanced flexibility and code modularity.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - Robust error handling for cases like insufficient funds and non-existent accounts.
